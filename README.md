# Programs:

### Routing Performance
A program that takes in a network topology and list of connection requests to simulate the requests over a virtual circuit network.
The program allows the user to select between three different routing protocols to direct packets across the virtual circuit network:
1. Shortest Hop Path (SHP)
2. Shortest Delay Path (SDP)
3. Least Loaded Path (LLP)
At the end of the program, it will print a summary of metrics to allow for analysis of routing performance.
